            In many languages, articles are a special part of speech which cannot be easily combined[clarification
            needed] with other parts of speech. In English grammar, articles are frequently considered part of a broader
            category called determiners, which contains articles, demonstratives (such as "this" and "that"), possessive
            determiners (such as "my" and "his"), and quantifiers (such as "all" and "few").[1] Articles and other
            determiners are also sometimes counted as a type of adjective, since they describe the words that they
            precede.[2]

            In languages that employ articles, every common noun, with some exceptions, is expressed with a certain
            definiteness, definite or indefinite, as an attribute (similar to the way many languages express every noun
            with a certain grammatical number—singular or plural—or a grammatical gender). Articles are among the most
            common words in many languages; in English, for example, the most frequent word is the.[3]
